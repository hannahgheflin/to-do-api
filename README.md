# To Do API

### Description:
A simple to-do list manager. Each user has an account with their own list that can be updated as they please. Users login or create an account and then are able to add, remove, and edit items on their to-do lists. These tasks will be assigned a creation date and the user will be able to assign them a due date/time. They will aslo be able to filter for items via their status (completed/uncompleted) or category-chosen upon creation (with the option of None). I am using this project as a building block for expanding my portfolio and development experience. I will be adding features one by one while changing the purpose of the application. For example, next I will implement JWT to improve user authentication as well as work with data modeling to create an expense tracker.
